    <h3>HISTORY</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Barcelona, commonly referred to as Barcelona and colloquially known as
      Barça , is a Spanish professional football club based in Barcelona,
      Catalonia, Spain. Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Spanish, English,
      and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol
      of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club"
      ("More than a club"). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own
      and operate Barcelona. It is the fourth-most valuable sports team in the
      world, worth $4.06 billion, and the world's richest football club in terms
      of revenue, with an annual turnover of €840,8 million.[2][3] The official
      Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça", written by Jaume Picas and Josep
      Maria Espinàs.[4] Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 74 trophies: 26
      La Liga, 30 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de España, 3 Copa Eva Duarte, and 2
      Copa de la Liga trophies, as well as being the record holder for the
      latter four competitions. In international club football, the club has won
      20 European and worldwide titles: 5 UEFA Champions League titles, a record
      4 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, a joint record 5 UEFA Super Cup, a record 3
      Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, and 3 FIFA Club World Cup.[5] Barcelona was ranked
      first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics
      Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2015[6][7] and
      currently occupies the third position on the UEFA club rankings.[8] The
      club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the
      two teams are referred to as El Clásico.
