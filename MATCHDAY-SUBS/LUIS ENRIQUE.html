 <p>On 19 May 2014, it was announced that Luis Enrique would return to Barcelona as a manager, after he agreed to a
 three-year deal. He was recommended by sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta, his former national teammate.His first
 competitive match was a 3–0 home league win over Elche CF, where he handed debuts to new signings Claudio Bravo, Jérémy
 Mathieu and Ivan Rakitić, and gave youth products Munir El Haddadi, Rafinha and Sandro their maiden league appearances
 for the club, while summer signing Luis Suárez was unavailable for selection due to suspension.
 
 Luis Enrique suffered his first defeat in the competition on 25 October 2014, away against Real Madrid, and although
 Barcelona had a successful run in the year, his management came under scrutiny because of his tactics involving several
 lineup changes in consecutive games. Moreover, a quarrel with Lionel Messi and other members of the team further
 accentuated the team's poor form.
 
 After an away loss to Real Sociedad, there was a significant upturn in Barcelona's form as a result of Luis Enrique
 deciding on a settled lineup. He equaled Guardiola's record of 11 consecutive victories, while the team went on to
 beat Atlético Madrid and Villarreal CF convincingly in the Copa del Rey to advance to the final. In the domestic league,
 after eight wins in nine matches, the team returned to the top of the table after 15 weeks.
 
 On 21 April 2015, Luis Enrique recorded his 42nd win after 50 games in charge of Barcelona with a 2–0 victory over Paris
 Saint-Germain FC, the best record of any manager. He went on to lead the side to the final of the UEFA Champions
 League and, on 17 May, led it to its 23rd national championship with one match to spare following a 1–0 win at the
 Vicente Calderón Stadium against Atlético Madrid. On 6 June, having earlier won the domestic cup against
 Athletic Bilbao by the same score, Barcelona sealed a treble with a 3–1 win over Juventus F.C. in the Champions League
 Final in Berlin, and three days later he signed a new contract until 2017.
 
 
 Luis Enrique lifts the 2015 UEFA Super Cup trophy
 On 11 August 2015, Barcelona won the 2015 UEFA Super Cup 5–4 against Sevilla FC. On 2 December, against CF
 Villanovense in the Copa del Rey Round of 32, Luis Enrique decided against bringing on a new player following Mathieu's
 injury with 12 minutes to go even though two replacements could still be made, as the score was at 6–1 at that time and
 the manager said he did not want to risk further setbacks.
 
 In his first two seasons, Luis Enrique rotated his goalkeepers, with Bravo playing league games and Marc-André ter
 Stegen playing cup and European matches. Both players, however, expressed opposition to this policy.[56][57] A second
 double was achieved on 22 May 2016, following a 2–0 Copa del Rey win over Sevilla FC after extra time in which the team
 played more than 50 minutes with one player less, following the dismissal of Javier Mascherano.[58]
 
 On 1 March 2017, Luis Enrique announced that he would not continue as team manager after 30 June on expiration of his
 contrac</p>
