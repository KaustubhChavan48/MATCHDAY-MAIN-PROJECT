 <p>“I give you my word that we will put in an effort. I don’t know if we’ll win, but we’ll persist. Put on your seat belts,
 because we’re going to have fun.”
 
 Two trophy-less seasons had passed when Barcelona finally decided to move on and replace Frank Rijkaard with the
 charismatic Josep ‘Pep’ Guardiola. This was what the man quoted during his presentation to the Camp Nou faithful. And
 like the old saying goes, “He came, he saw and he conquered.”
 
 Six seasons with the Blaugranes and he stands as one the most sought after coaches on the planet. Pep Guardiola not only
 made the Barcelona slogan ‘Mes que un club’ even more meaningful, but he made Barcelona more than just a name.
 Guardiola’s Barcelona represented a faith, a belief, a philosophy which reaped rich dividends by dominating the
 footballing world for nearly a half of a decade. The all-conquering season of 2008-09 & the demolition of Sir Alex
 Ferguson led Manchester United in 2010-11 were a reasonable proof of Barcelona being one of the greatest sides to play
 the game.
 
 Alas! What goes up must come down & in a similar way the post-Guardiola era has been pretty woeful for the Catalan
 giants. Barcelona have won just seven trophies under three different managers since 2010-11 which is woeful as compared
 to the 14 trophies won by Pep during his four years at the Camp Nou. The Catalan bandwagon has also come to a halt under
 current manager Luis Enrique after two consecutive defeats against Real Madrid, Celta Vigo and a struggling win against
 Almeria. Has Barcelona lost its sheen, its mettle? One thing is for sure, Barcelona no longer intimidate their opponents
 like they used to. The defenses around the world have evolved and coaches have found that taking the game to Barcelona
 does have a positive effect. Meanwhile Barcelona still remain stagnant and they continue to believe in the same
 philosophy which is both good and bad in a way, and makes us wonder what exactly is different in the current Barcelona
 system than what it was during the Guardiola reign.
 
 Accepting the fact that Evolution is inevitable
 Back when Barcelona were at their best, thrashing teams at their will; most of the teams they faced were already in the
 damage control mode. Teams feared humiliation even before the game started and the motivation of the highly-spirited
 teams was killed-off by tiring possession football that Barca inherit. But those days are long gone. Inevitably the game
 has evolved and coaches have found a way to counter the Barcelona way which is also famously called ‘Tiki-Taka’.
 
 It is now high time when Barcelona accept that they longer can intimidate and make a fool of their opponents. They can
 no longer just show up and expect the battle to be half-won. The effectiveness of their famous formation, a 4-3-3 with a
 False Nine has declined; whatever the reasons and there must be an acceptance by the Barcelona management at probably
 changing the system or at least evolving it so they could regain some lost pride.
 
 On top of that, Guardiola did not employ his 4-3-3 at Bayern Munich given the players he had available did not comply
 the requirements. He has evolved his brand of possession football since leaving the Camp Nou and has taken it to a whole
 new level by tinkering and trying new formations for the Bavarians, Thus, Barcelona or their current manager Luis
 Enrique must also take a page out of Pep’s book and take a positive step towards a new look Barcelona system which would
 not dwell around the same tactics.

 Pep’s Barcelona was based on the foundations of unison, work rate, ball movement, patience, anticipation and most
 importantly dynamism. He conquered all the possible trophies in his first season in charge by mostly playing 4-3-3. Many
 would argue that Guardiola just put a bunch of talented players together but the man had a reason and a specific plan
 about how he wanted his players to play and he let go of those who did not fit the bill. Ronaldinho, Deco and later
 Samuel Eto’o, who were the rulers of the Barcelona dynasty then under Rijkaard were asked to leave the ship because Pep
 didn’t think he could fit them into his module. He let go and bought the right players at the time.</p>
