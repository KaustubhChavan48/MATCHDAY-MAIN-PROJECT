            Xavier Hernández Creus; born 25 January 1980), nicknamed Xavi, is a
            Spanish football manager and former player who is the manager of
            Qatar Stars League football club Al Sadd. Highly regarded for his
            humble personality and team ethics, Xavi is viewed as being the
            embodiment of the tiki-taka passing style of play, and is widely
            considered to be one of the greatest central midfielders of all
            time. He is also considered by many to be one of the greatest
            Spanish players ever. Xavi joined La Masia, the Barcelona youth
            academy, at age 11, and made his first-team debut against Mallorca
            in August 1998. In all, he played over 700 matches, a club record,
            and scored 85 goals. Xavi is the first player in the club's history
            to play 150 European and FIFA Club World Cup matches combined.[8]
            With Barcelona, Xavi won eight La Liga titles and four UEFA
            Champions League titles. He has won 31 trophies for Barcelona and
            Spain, a total only surpassed by Andrés Iniesta as the most
            decorated Spanish player in history.[9][10] Xavi came third in the
            2009 FIFA World Player of the Year, followed by third place for its
            successor award, the FIFA Ballon d'Or, in 2010 and 2011. In 2011, he
            was runner up to Lionel Messi for the UEFA Best Player in Europe
            Award. With Spain, Xavi won the FIFA World Youth Championship in
            1999, and the Olympic silver medal at the 2000 Olympics. After
            making his senior team debut in 2000, he was capped 133 times for
            the Spain national team, and was an influential figure in the team's
            successes. He played an integral role in Spain's victory at the 2010
            FIFA World Cup, as well as their wins at both UEFA Euro 2008 and
            UEFA Euro 2012. He was named Player of the Tournament at UEFA Euro
            2008,[11] and was named in the UEFA Euro Team of the Tournament in
            2008 and 2012. At UEFA Euro 2012, with his two assists in the final,
            Xavi became the first player to register assists in two separate
            UEFA Euro finals, having set up the only goal in the final four
            years earlier.[12] He had a 91% passing success rate at the 2010
            FIFA World Cup and was named in the World Cup All-Star Team. After
            the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Xavi announced his retirement from
            international football.[13] Xavi was awarded the IFFHS World's Best
            Playmaker award four times: 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011. He was included
            in the UEFA Team of the Year five times (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011,
            2012), and was included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI on six
            occasions: 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013. Xavi was awarded the
            Prince of Asturias Award for Sports in 2012.

          <h4>Iniesta</h4>

            Andrés Iniesta Luján; born 11 May 1984) is a Spanish professional
            footballer who plays as a central midfielder for Japanese club
            Vissel Kobe. He spent most of his career at Barcelona, where he
            served as the captain for three seasons. Iniesta is widely
            considered to be one of the best players of his generation and one
            of the greatest midfielders of all time. Iniesta came through La
            Masia, the Barcelona youth academy, after an early migration from
            his birthplace, and impressed from an early age. He made his
            first-team debut aged 18 in 2002. He began playing regularly during
            the 2004–05 season and remained in the team until 2018. Iniesta was
            an integral part of the Barcelona sides that won two historic
            trebles in 2009 and 2015, and his 35 trophies, which includes nine
            La Ligas and four UEFA Champions League titles, make him the most
            decorated Spanish footballer of all time.[9] After twenty-two years
            at Barcelona, Iniesta signed for Japanese club Vissel Kobe in 2018.
            Iniesta played for Spain at the Under-16, Under-19 and Under-21
            levels before making his international debut in 2006. He helped
            Spain win UEFA Euro 2008, playing every game and being selected in
            the Team of the Tournament. Iniesta was also a key member of the
            victorious Spanish team at the 2010 FIFA World Cup; he scored the
            winning goal in the final against the Netherlands, for which he was
            named the Man of the Match, and was selected to the tournament's
            All-Star Team. At UEFA Euro 2012, Iniesta led Spain to their second
            consecutive continental crown, again being chosen as the Man of the
            Match of the final against Italy, and was named the Player of the
            Tournament. Iniesta has been named in the FIFA FIFPro World XI nine
            times and was chosen in the UEFA Team of the Year on six occasions.
            He was named in the All-time UEFA Euro XI. He won the UEFA Best
            Player in Europe Award in 2012 and was named the IFFHS World's Best
            Playmaker in 2012 and 2013. Iniesta was runner-up to Lionel Messi
            for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or and achieved third place in 2012.
